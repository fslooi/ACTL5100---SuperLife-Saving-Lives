## Overview

In the modern age of Lumaria, health is increasingly recognized as the ultimate wealth. BrightPath Consulting, in collaboration with SuperLife Insurance, introduces a cutting-edge health incentive program designed to encourage healthy behaviours among policyholders, thereby reducing mortality rates, boosting life insurance sales, and enhancing market competitiveness.

This GitHub repository houses all project materials for the SuperLife Insurance Incentive Program, including data analyses, R coding scripts, modelling methodologies, and comprehensive documentation on pricing strategies and sensitivity testing analysis. We aim to provide a transparent, detailed overview of our approach to creating a sustainable, beneficial program for SuperLife and its customers.

## Project Report Summary

### Executive Summary

The SuperLife Health Incentive Program, developed by BrightPath Consulting, aims to incentivize healthy behaviours among policyholders in Lumaria. We anticipate decreased mortality rates, improved sales, and enhanced marketability by integrating preventive screenings and smoking cessation programs into SuperLife's life insurance offerings.

### Program Design

The program focuses on interventions for non-smoking and smoking policyholders, promoting preventive health screenings and supporting smoking cessation efforts. These strategies will contribute to a healthier, more engaged policyholder base.

### Pricing and Modelling

Utilizing ARIMA for inflation and interest rates, Cox PH for mortality rates, Kaplan-Meier for lapse behaviour, and linear regression for sales prediction, we have developed robust models to guide pricing and program sustainability. Assumptions and methodologies are detailed in the appendices.

### Risk Analysis

Identified risks such as climate change, inflation, and pandemics are addressed through strategic mitigation efforts. Our comprehensive risk analysis framework ensures program resilience.

### Conclusion

The SuperLife Health Incentive Program is poised to meet its objectives, improving policyholder mortality while adding value to SuperLife's offerings. Ongoing monitoring and adjustments based on the Actuarial Control Cycle will ensure its continued success.
